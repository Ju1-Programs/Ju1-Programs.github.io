        <h2>About This Game</h2>
        It's a lovely morning in the village and you are a horrible goose.
        <br><br>Untitled Goose Game is a slapstick-stealth-sandbox, where you are a goose let loose on an unsuspecting village. Make your way around town, from peoples' back gardens to the high street shops to the village green, setting up pranks, stealing
        hats, honking a lot, and generally ruining everyoneâ€™s day.
        <h2 class="bb_tag">Featuring:</h2>
        <ul class="bb_ul">
            <li>A horrible goose (that's you)<br></li>
            <li>A town full of people just trying to get on with their day (you hate them)<br></li>
            <li>A dedicated honk button (!!!)</li>
        </ul><img src="assets/images/chase600.png">
        <h2 class="bb_tag">AND ALSO</h2>Oh dear! Two horrible geese!<br><br>You can now enjoy Untitled Goose Game with a friend, in a new two-player cooperative mode. Play through the whole game as two horrible geese, honking twice as much, teaming up to plan pranks, and
        generally ruining everyone's day, together.<br><br>
